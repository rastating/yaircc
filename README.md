# yaircc

yaircc (pronounced yerk) is a free, open-source IRC client for Windows that complies with the standards set by both RFC 1459 and RFC 2812, and also supports a number of defacto standards that have become a part of many IRC clients over the years, such as custom font colours, action messages and more.
